    genericName: Mobile App
    longDescription: >
      VerificaC19 is the official app of the Italian government, developed 
      by the Ministry of Health in collaboration with the Ministry for 
      Technological Innovation and Digitization, the Ministry of Economy and 
      Finance and the Extraordinary Commissioner for the COVID-19 Emergency, 
      for enable operators to verify the validity and authenticity of COVID-19 
      Green Certificates issued by Italy National DGC Platform of the Ministry 
      of Health and by the other Member States of the European Union.
      The app is developed and released in full compliance with the protection 
      of the user's personal data and current legislation, in particular 
      the decree-law of 22 April 2021, n. 52, as well as the European technical 
      specifications approved by the eHealth Network for the EU Digital COVID 
      Certificate (formerly Digital Green Certificate).

      VerificaC19 app allows the operators in charge to verify the 
      validity of the COVID-19 green certifications and the 
      "EU Digital COVID Certificates" by reading the certificate QR code. 
      The app does not store or communicate the scanned information to third 
      parties. The app performs the verification in offline mode, 
      i.e. without invoking a remote system service when it is used. 
      In order to verify the certificate authenticity the app must access the 
      backend of the DGC national platfor at least once a day, connected to 
      the European gateway (DGCG), where all the public keys used to sign 
      the "EU Digital COVID Certificate” are collected.

      The workflow of the VerificationC19 app is divided into 
      the following phases:
      - The person who must verify the certification asks the user 
      to show the QR code of his certificate
      - Using the app, the QR code is read and its authenticity is verified 
      using the public key signing the certificate
      - Once the information contained in the COVID-19 Green Certification or 
      the "EU Digital COVID Certificate" has been decoded, the app shows the 
      main information:
      - Name, surname and date of birth of the certificate holder
      - Unique identifier of the certificate
      - Validity of the certificate
      - The certificate is verified against the decoded date information and 
      the Italian rules for COVID-19 green certifications.
      - The person in charge proceeds to visually check the correspondence of 
      the personal data of the holder shown by the VerificationC19 app and 
      certificate holder ID card.
